# Resume
As the name suggests this is my repository where I maintain my resumes for different roles. 

# Motivation
I was tired of keeping track of 20+ resume versions when I first started making them using MS Word. 
MS Word is great and if you want to make a beautiful resume in a short period of time it is a good choice.
But personally, I don't need the most creative resume layouts. My requirements were simple:

- I wanted to have a version history 🗃️
- I wanted to organize slightly different resumes for different roles 👨‍🏫 💻
- I wanted a clean and sleek design that I can reuse 📁

# My solution
LaTex, fulfilled all my needs. It can be easily tracked using Git. I can define a theme and reuse it. Moreover, it has smart functionality like getting the today's date which helps me build my cover letters.

# Why is this open-source?
Why shouldn't it be? Everyone can see my resume, there is no harm in sharing how I build it. If you find this useful, feel free to replicate this setup. 😄
